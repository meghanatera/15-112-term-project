# 15-112-term-project

This is my 15-112 Term Project and is called CMU Personalized Menu. This program web scrapes different restaurants near the CMU area - Oakland, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, and provides the user with the restaurant that suits their choices. The menu displays the restaurant name, where it is located, food names, and food prices. From the menu, the user can see more information if they want, similar restaurants to the one on their menu, and their past menu.

How to run:
The user should run the file named: “FINAL.py”. If the user wants to download the web scraped images they should run the file named: “images.py”.

Libraries used:
1. Beautiful Soup
2. Requests
3. PIL

Shortcut Commands:
1. Press ‘r’ once on the menu page to get a different menu
2. Press the left arrow key if you want to go back
3. Click the square box if you want to order the prices from lowest to highest
